<h1>The Daily Loaf</h1> opened in 2022 when former food journalist Sarah Rae traded her press pass for a baker's apron.
After years of covering restaurant openings and food trends for the Baltimore Sun, Sarah realized her true passion was
creating the stories herself—one loaf at a time.</p>
<p>Located just off the Thames Street in Fell's Point, The Daily Loaf brings together Sarah's two loves: storytelling
    and sourdough. Every morning, we "publish" fresh batches of artisan breads and pastries using traditional techniques
    and local ingredients. Just like a great news story, our baking is honest, crafted with care, and meant to be
    shared.</p>
<p>Whether you're a student pulling an all-nighter or a professional preparing for morning calls, The Daily Loaf is your
    daily source for fresh-baked goodness.</p>

<p>"As a journalism major, I had to try this place. The Breaking News Sourdough lives up to the hype! Now
    I'm
    here every Tuesday morning before class. The owner Sarah always remembers my order."<br><em>-- Alex
        P.</em></p>

    enough
    to drink all day. Plus the cinnamon rolls? Front-page worthy!"<br><em>-- Jordan M.</em></p>
<p>"Love the journalism theme and the bread is even better than the puns. The Everything Bagels are my go-to
    breakfast before hitting the library. Plus, the student discount is clutch!"<br><em>-- Casey R.</em></p>
