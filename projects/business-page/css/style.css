/* NOTE- 

Step 1: Getting started
Create your file/folder structure. Then, begin your HTML file with your HTML boilerplate, making sure Bootstrap is included.
Copy in the text file from Drive into the <body>section of your file.
Download the images in the Drive file and save them in your imgfolder.

Step 2: Building your landing page
Your page must include:
Descriptive <title> tag and meta description
Semantic markup (<header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>)
At least one Google Font
At least 2 gridded sections (.row + .col-*) as well as using a .container or .container-fluid
Responsive breakpoints (use classes likecol-md-6 col-lg-4)
Responsive images (use .img-fluid class on all images)
Possible use of .align-items-* and .justify-content-* utility classes

Step 3: Responsive testing
Check your design across multiple breakpoints/screen sizes
Test in Chrome DevTools at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) sizes
Ensure content stacks properly on mobile and spreads out on larger screens*/
